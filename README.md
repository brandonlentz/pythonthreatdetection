# Python Threat Detection Script

This script creates a socket and listens for incoming connections on the specified IP address and port. When a connection is received, it receives data from the client and checks it for potential threats by searching for a specific string (bad string). If the string is found, it prints a message indicating a possible threat has been detected.
